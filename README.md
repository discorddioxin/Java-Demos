# Java Demos
### Expectations
 - You should have knowledge to execute basic Java programs
   - An IDE helps
   - Demos require at least Java 8+ unless explicitly specified otherwise
   - Some demos may require a higher version of java - these demos will explicitly specify which version
   
 - For demos using 3rd party libraries, you are expected to know how to add it to your project's build path
   - Links to obtain the library will be provided in the demo as a comment
   
 - Any programming questions about the code here should first be taken to a programming discord server before contacting me
   - If you see a mistake, feel free to contact me right away
   
### Future Maintenance & Contributions
 - I will maintain and contribute as time goes on. However, it's possible that what you see now is all there will be.
 
 - If you would like to contribute, feel free to contact me on discord

   - Content must not introduce design concepts that complicate the learning process
     - Do not introduce new types unless it's a requirement
     - Think in terms of teaching, not designing the most flexible demo possible
